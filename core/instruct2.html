<p>In this task, you will use the "e" and "i" computer keys to categorize words into groups as fast as you can, while making as few mistakes as possible. Going too slow or making too many mistakes will result in an uninterpretable score. Below are the four categories and the items that belong to each. The first two categories include traits that people often say are important in a <u>long-term romantic partner</u> (such as a marriage partner). The second two categories include synonyms of the words desirable and undesirable.</p>

<table>
    <tr><td>Category</td><td>Items</td></tr>
    <tr><td id="clabel1"></td><td id="citems1"></td>
    <tr><td id="clabel2"></td><td id="citems2"></td>
    <tr><td id="clabelA"></td><td id="citemsA"></td>
    <tr><td id="clabelB"></td><td id="citemsB"></td>
</table>


<p>KEEP IN MIND</p>
<ul>
    <li>Keep your index fingers on the 'e' and 'i' keys to enable rapid response.</li>
    <li>Two labels at the top will tell you which words go with each key. Each word has a correct classification.</li>
    <li>Your results will be uninterprettable if you go too slow -- please try to go as fast as possible.</li>
    <li>Expect to make a few mistakes because of going fast. That is okay.</li>
    <li>For best results, make sure that your monitor is set to maximum brightness and avoid distractions.</li>
    <li><b>The instructions change for each part of this task, so make sure to pay attention!</b></li>
