<h2>Welcome to the Dating and Mating Study!</h2>

<p>You are being asked to participate in a research study examining the characteristics that unmarried adults value in a romantic partner. Specifically, your participation in this study will contribute to a better understanding of the factors that influence people’s partnering behaviors and the ways that they think about relationships. If you choose to participate you will complete a number of categorization activities as well as questionnaires about your personal attitudes, and, if applicable, your current romantic relationship. We estimate that it will take about 20-25 minutes of your time to complete the entire study.</p>

<p>There will be no cost for participating, nor will you directly benefit from participating in this study, aside from earning a monetary compensation. The risks of participating are considered minimal and include the possibility of mild psychological distress brought on by answering questions about your own romantic relationships. However, the likelihood of this happening is quite low. A limited amount of identifying information (email address) will be collected from you during the study for tracking purposes <u>only</u> if you indicate that you would like to receive an invitation to participate in two optional follow-up surveys. To ensure the complete confidentiality of your responses, all information will be encrypted and stored in a secure database during data collection and will be deleted from the dataset when the study is finished.</p>

<p>Your participation in the Dating and Mating Study is voluntary. You may decline to answer any question and you have the right to withdraw from participation at any time without penalty. If you choose to participate, you will receive a compensation of $0.75 for the initial study, $1.00 for the first follow-up three months later, and $1.50 for the second follow-up six months from the initial data collection.</p>

<p>This study has been reviewed and approved by the Hope College Human Subject’s Review Board (HSRB).
